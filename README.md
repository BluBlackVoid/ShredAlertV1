# ShredAlertV1
Rogue-like browser game

Made using Replit. https://replit.com/@shaunetrata05/V10-Shred-Alert
To run on replit, log in (or sign up), then fork and run the project on replit. Press the new tab button to open the web game on a new page.

Alternatively, you can download all the files, and then upload and run it on a server.
[There's also a bunch of other small projects and tests on my old replit]
